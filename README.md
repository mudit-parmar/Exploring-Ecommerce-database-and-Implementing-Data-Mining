# Exploring-Ecommerce-database-and-Implementing-Data-Mining
A large ecommerce dataset present over kaggle is used to populate our relational database. It is a complex dataset containing information of more than 100K orders made at multiple platforms from 2016 to 2018. ER diagram for this schema is generated with proper entities, attributes, relationships between them, cardinality constraints, atomicity, integration constraints, and foreign and primary keys. Tables are created and populated using the SQL commands. Using this efficient storing, retrieving and managing of data are achieved with minimal query processing time. Also, unsupervised learning is applied using Natural Language Processing to analyze the sentiments of the reviews the customer gave. The results show that delivery time and product condition plays a vital role in the customer satisfaction.
